Changed the origanal code to make it cleaner with less repeating code.

 On the CSS, the content sections all followed the same specs for margin, height, font etc. so instead of having three seprate chunks of code for each section, I changed the classes on the HTML to "content-section" and then on the CSS I deleted the replicates and created one chunk of code that called to the "content-section" class. This then kept all the specs of the sections the same with less code. I then did the same thing for the images and h2,h3 of the sections.

 I then changed the title to "Horiseon" so that when opened on a browser, the name of the actual website is displayed on the tab instead of "website".

 I then changed the "div" to 'section" and "article" to follow a more sematic HTML format.
